## Introduction
Welcome to the world of cutting-edge home automation, powered by NodeMCU (ESP8266). This project is not just about controlling appliances; it's about revolutionizing the way you interact with your home. With NodeMCU at its core, along with a relay module and the TSOP1738 IR receiver, I've created a home automation system that blends modern technology with convenience.

## Key Features
- **Remote Appliance Control:** Imagine turning on your coffee machine in the morning, right from your bed. With this system, you can remotely control up to two home appliances, all with a few taps on your smartphone or using your trusty TV or AC remote.

- **Blynk Integration:** We've integrated Blynk, the powerhouse of IoT app development, to provide a seamless user experience. Control your appliances and receive real-time status updates with ease, thanks to Blynk's virtual pins.

- **Universal Remote Support:** Ever wished your TV or AC remote could do more? Now, it can. By coding these remotes into NodeMCU, you'll unlock the ability to control appliances with your existing devices.

- **Efficient Power Supply:** Safety first! Our system incorporates a dedicated AC to DC converter, ensuring a reliable and secure power supply that transforms 220V AC into a stable 5V DC source.

## Hardware Setup
We've taken care of the technicalities, and the result is a sleek and organized hardware setup. Soldered NodeMCU on a vero board, connected to the relay module, TSOP IR receiver, and the AC to DC converter – this project embodies efficiency and safety.

## Easy to Use
The best part? It's incredibly user-friendly. Connect NodeMCU to your Wi-Fi, install the Blynk app, and set it up to communicate with your NodeMCU via virtual pins. Adding appliances to the system is a breeze – just code their IR signals into the NodeMCU, and you're good to go.


**Note:** Always prioritize safety when working with electrical components, especially when dealing with high voltage AC connections.
